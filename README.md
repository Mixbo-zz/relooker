# RElooker

RElooker is a simple Reverse Engineering software designed to visualize binary information with colorful representations and stats. It is 100% cross platform (even if the formatting sometimes sucks).

Basic editing will also be possible sooner or later.

## Which files can I analyze?
Anything. Most features are structure independant and interpret the actual content of the file instead of relying on headers and/or prior knowledge. Open any file -> What you see is what you get.
