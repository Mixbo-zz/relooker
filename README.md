# RElooker

RElooker is a simple Reverse Engineering software designed to visualize binary information with colorful representations and stats. It is 100% cross platform (even if the formatting sometimes sucks).

Basic editing will also be possible sooner or later.
Current release is [v0.1.0](https://github.com/Mixbo/relooker/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

## Which files can I analyze?
Any. Most features are structure independant and interpret the actual content of the file instead of relying on headers and/or prior knowledge. What you see is what you get.
