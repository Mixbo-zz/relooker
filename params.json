It is 100% cross platform (even if the formatting sometimes sucks).\r\n\r\nBasic editing will also be possible sooner or later.\r\nCurrent release is [v0.2.0](https://github.com/Mixbo/relooker/releases/tag/v0.2.0)\r\n\r\n## Which files can I analyze?\r\nAny.

What you see is what you get.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://wakowakowako.com/mixbo/4_screen.png)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n#### Currently Working\r\n* 2D Visualization\r\n  * Value range (Null,FF,Low,High,Ascii)\r\n* Hex Viewer\r\n* String Highlight\r\n\r\n#### ToDo\r\n* Entropy Viewer\r\n* Call Structure Viewer\r\n* Media listing\r\n* 3D Viewer (!)\r\n* Create Editors\r\n  * Hex Editor\r\n  * Strings Editor\r\n  * Ressources Editor\r\n  * Disassembly Editor (!)\r\n* Add Graphic Stats (Pie Charts!)\r\n\r\nVisit [the wiki](https://github.com/Mixbo/relooker/wiki) for more informations on which features are being developped.\r\nIf you want the ~~latest~~ **unstable** version, consider cloning the [dev branch](https://github.com/Mixbo/relooker/tree/dev).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
